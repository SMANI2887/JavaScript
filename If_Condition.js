/* 2. Using if-else Statement
The if-else statement will perform some action for a specific condition. Here we are using the else statement in which the else statement is written after the if statement and it has no condition in their code block.

Syntax: */

if (condition1) {
    // Executes when condition1 is true
    if (condition2) {
        // Executes when condition2 is true
    }
}

// Example: In this example, we are using if-else conditional statement to check the driving licence eligibility date.

let age = 25;

if (age >= 18) {
    console.log("You are eligible of driving licence")
} else {
    console.log("You are not eligible for driving licence")
};
